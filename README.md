### Hi!

By day, I'm an engineer, researcher and educator working to improve thermodynamic modelling in both fundamental and empirical/statistical applications. The rest of the time (and actually during the day too), I'm a husband, dad and avid consumer of new information. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few different thermodynamic projects!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning (upskilling in) relevant Python libraries and Julia packages
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: cripwell@sun.ac.za
